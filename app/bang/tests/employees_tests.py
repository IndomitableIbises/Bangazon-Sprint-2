#       Your test suite must verify that the response has an employees collection in the context.

#   * Your test suite must verify that the correct template was used to render the response.

#   * Your test suite must verify that the content of the response has one, or more, of the values that are expected. For example, if one of the employees in Fred Jackson, then your test must test that both "Fred" and "Jackson" are in the response content. Likewise for the department.

# * Your test suite must verify that the content of the response has all of the required input fields.

#   * Your test suite must verify that the response has a department collection in the context in order for the drop down to be populated.

#   * Your test suite must verify that the content of the response has all of the expected values of the employee - name, department, computer, and training programs.

#   * Your test suite must verify that the response has an employee object in the context.

#  * Your test suite must verify that the content of the response has all of the required input fields.

#   * Your test suite must verify that the response has an employee collection in the context, and contains all of the properties needed for populating the form.
